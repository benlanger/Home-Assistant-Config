Here, I will compile a list of my Zigbee devices and my thought on them.


## Buy again notes:

| Symbol | Means |
| :---: | --- |
| :heavy_check_mark: | Yes |
| :pause_button: | Waiting on the next generation of this. |
| :grey_question: | Maybe - it's not bad, but I'm looking for something better |
| :thumbsdown: | Unlikely, it's not terrible, but it has some issues |
| :small_red_triangle: | There's a newer version that's better |
| :no_entry: | Discontinued |
| :warning: | Won't buy again |
