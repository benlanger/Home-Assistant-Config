# Indoor Localisation Detection

Since I am always trying new things, I've explored indoor-localisation using 7 ESP32s and a [Minew Bracelet](https://www.minew.com/products/b7-wristband-beacon.html) attached to my ankle.  
This allows for a high level of precisions when it comes to knowing in which room I am located.  
  
  
The software used for this is [free and open source](https://espresense.com/). And regularly updated as well!

### The ESP32s are located as follow in the appartment, offering good detection in "main" rooms, and being less precise with others. <br>
